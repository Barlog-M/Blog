**Oceanic Primal** is a color theme that built in opposite to [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) color themes with fewer color and more ocean.

Based on [Oceanic Primal palette](https://github.com/oceanic-primal/palette), inspired by [Oceanic-Next.vim](https://github.com/mhartington/oceanic-next)
